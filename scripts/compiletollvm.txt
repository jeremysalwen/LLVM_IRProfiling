If you are using a compiler besides clang, you need to somehow get the llvm 
bytecode output.

To do this with clang, first make sure you have link time optimization with 
clang working. You need to set

CC=clang
CFLAGS+="-flto" 
LDFLAGS+="-flto -Wl,-plugin-opt=also-emit-llvm"

or whatever the equivalent is in your build system.  For make (assuming your 
makefile can work with alternative cflags) it would just be

make CC=clang CFLAGS=-flto LDFLAGS="-flto -Wl,-plugin-opt=also-emit-llvm"

In general, just make sure you are compiling with clang, and set up your build 
system to pass those additonal flags at the compilation and linking step, 
respectively.
